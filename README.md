# **Ascii Char Sequence class**
* Compact storage of a sequence of ASCII characters (1 symbol - 1 byte). Prior to Java 9, the String class stored each character as a char (2 bytes), AsciiCharSequence realization will take two times less memory.
* The AsciiCharSequence class should:
    * implement the java.lang.CharSequence interface;
    * have a constructor that takes an array of bytes;
    * define methods length(), charAt(), subSequence() and toString()
